## Installation

```bash
apm install atom-spec-gutter
```

## Desired features

* Ability to start and stop background loaders like Zeus
* Failure details when hovering over a marker

## Help wanted

I have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to Atom plugins, so feel free to contribute. I just wanted to make a sexier test runner than what was currently out there.
